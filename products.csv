Featuring a fresh and delicate floral design, the Leah Bisch Academic Year Weekly/Monthly Planner's helps you keep your day, month and year organized. The weekly spreads provide unruled daily blocks for capturing your plans your way, while a separate week-spanning block accommodates anything that doesn't fit neatly into any one day. Monthly spreads are tabbed for easy navigation and deliver a familiar daily-block format, a separate notes column as well as past- and future-month reference calendars. Additional resources and references help you stay on track and meticulously plan out this year, well into the next. Double-sided pocket storage pocket accommodates loose-sheets, receipts, event tickets and more. Attractive yet durable poly cover stands up to wear and tear, while reliable, snag-free twin-wire binding keeps everything neatly together.","Global Product Type: Appointment Book/Personal Organizers

Westcott uses a process that bonds Titanium Bonded to the blades and then coats them with a breakthrough non-stick formula to produce an adhesive-resistant, easy-to-clean, and longer-lasting cutting edge. Glide provides a no tool adjustable glide technology for optimal cutting performance which allows less tension for thin materials and higher tension for thicker material. These scissors will stay sharp, smooth-cutting and residue-free for years making them an exceptional value like all Westcott products.","Global Product Type: All Purpose Scissors & Shears
