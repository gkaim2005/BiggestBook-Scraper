"KMW58359","Magnetic Monitor Privacy Screen for 27"" Widescreen Flat Panel Monitors, 16:9 Aspect Ratio","Privacy screens protect monitors from scratches and damage, while providing privacy, reducing harmful blue light, diminishing glare, and improving clarity. Patented design includes a slim magnetic strip, allowing for quick and easy attachment and removal of privacy screen. Allows for unobstructed viewing, making it an excellent solution for slim bezel or edge-to-edge displays. Limited viewing angle narrows the field of vision to +/- 30 degrees, helping keep the information on your screen private and reducing the chances of a visual data breach. Blue light reduction filters out harmful rays by up to 22%, easing eye strain and reducing the chances of interrupting sleep patterns. Low reflective coating reduces glare for improved clarity. With reversible viewing options, one side has a matte finish to maximize glare reduction and reduce traces of fingerprints. The other side is glossy and provides a clearer view of the monitor. The MagPro Monitor Privacy Screen with Magnetic Strip is TAA-compliant, supporting federal government purchasing protocols.","Global Product Type: Frameless Monitor Filters
